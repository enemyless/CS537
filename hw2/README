Finished all the required part. When using valgrind to debug, I found something interesting. When exiting the process, if I forget to free the space allocated to some pointer, there may be an error saying that "memory definately lost". When I fixed this bug, there will be no errors reported by valgrind. However, if I use --show-reachable=yes option to run valgrind, there may still be some "still reachable memory" reported by valgrind, but they are not counted as errors. So I am confused what is the difference between "definately lost memory" and "still reachable memory" and why the first one counted as error but not counted as error for the second one.
